# Calculator Programs Repo

This is a new and improved version of [my original calculator-focused repo](https://github.com/myclevorname/flake), which only provided a program builder.
The older repo still exists and is catered towards flakes, but this Nix repo is meant to be a collection of calculator programs.

## Contributing

If you want to see a program added to the repo or would want a program to be updated, feel free to open a GitHub issue.
See `pkgs/ce-programs/oiram/default.nix` for a template.
If you aren't a Nixpkgs maintainer, omit the `meta.maintainers` attribute.
